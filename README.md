# terminalPlot
Plot a function within the terminal

# How To Run

Download the files and compile for your computer, I use the GNU compiler collection.
Run the following command from the directory that the files are stored:
```
g++ -std=c++11 -o plotter terminalPlot.cpp
```
You can name the compiled file what ever you'd like by replacing ```plotter``` with your desired name.
To run the compiled file, either open the file with your file explorer, or open it with terminal

# How To Use

When the program is run, you are prompted with which type of function to plot.
Choose the appropriate function, then enter the variables when asked.
The program shoul return the interpreted f(x) and a graph of f(x).

If the graph looks strange make sure that the terminal window can display the entire x-axis on one line.
